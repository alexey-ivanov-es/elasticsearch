# REST Handler Codegen — Project Plan

This folder contains the project plan and tracking files for the **Elasticsearch REST Handler Code Generation** work.

---

## Where to find things

| What | File |
|------|------|
| **Full project plan** | [es-rest-handler-codegen-plan.md](es-rest-handler-codegen-plan.md) |
| **List of tasks (with status)** | [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) |
| **List of changed files** | [CHANGED-FILES.md](CHANGED-FILES.md) |

---

## Update rule

**Always update the list of tasks and the list of files for every change committed.**

- When you complete or progress a task, update **TASKS.md** and set the status (e.g. to `Done`).
- When you add, modify, or remove any file as part of this project, update **CHANGED-FILES.md** (new / modified / removed) in the same commit.

This keeps the plan folder accurate and reviewable without digging through git history.
